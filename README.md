Graphite Drawing
================

Introduction
------------

Graphite is a drawing application for Ubuntu touch designed to run primarily on tablets, but will also work on phones and desktop computers. Its goals are ease of use, simplicity and to produce outcomes which look semi-natural.

This app is being developed for the [Ubuntu App Showdown](http://developer.ubuntu.com/showdown/).
